# IOT_Water_Management
water management using IOT based sensors to control physical devices such as pumps

The water management system detailed here is a project that applies IOT principles for automating water sensing and min-max replenishment using a water pump. Additionally the project has provisions for remote water management using mobile notifications. The system once setup can manage water levels in tank and based on defined water levels will trigger the pump. 
The above project is a simple IOT use case that I have demonstrated here. However the elaborate use case (yet to be published) has Analytics, Data Logging, IOT platform for complete water system management that can be applied to any real world application involving physical devices such as Pumps, Motors, Servo Devices, Swithgear etc. 
 
Working Model :  When the water level in the Tank goes down to a certain threshold, it automatically starts the pump. The notification and the moisture level is shared to user using telnet through Pushetta notifications. Explore the project here.
